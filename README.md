# Kato Hubot Adapter

## Description

The Kato Hubot adapter allows you to send messages to Hubot from a Kato room and receive messages back.

## Installation

Install Hubot (consult the [Hubot documentation](https://github.com/github/hubot/tree/master/docs) for more information):

    $ sudo npm install -g yo generator-hubot

Create a new bot:

    $ mkdir myhubot
    $ cd myhubot
    $ yo hubot

You will be asked which adapter to use, type `kato`

## Configuration

First, create a new Kato account for your bot. It’s best to create a new email address, eg. `kato-bot@mycompany.com` and invite this address to your Kato team. Verify the email and set a name for your bot in its new account (that name shows up when it posts a message).

Next, you will need to set some environment variables:

    $ export HUBOT_KATO_LOGIN="katobot@mycompany.com"
    $ export HUBOT_KATO_PASSWORD="5prz8OKty6"

## Usage

Once that’s done, you can start Hubot with Kato as the adapter:

    $ ./bin/hubot -a kato

Please ignore "npm WARN" and "depricated" messages, that are generated by hubot itself. You shoud be able to see your bot online in kato just a few seconds after you ran this command.

### Notes
Kato addapter supports listening for commands in a rooms and 1 on 1 chats.
You can address your bot by beginning a message with its name, which defaults to "Hubot".
(Bot not listening messages from user which credentials is used for Hubot login)

You can change this and also set an alias using the following additional environment vars:

    $ export HUBOT_NAME="Frank"
    $ export HUBOT_ALIAS="!"

Your bot should now answer `!ping` with `PONG`.

#### Logging option
Optional log filename (by default filename is kato-hubot.log):

    $ export HUBOT_KATO_LOG_FILE="filename.log"

or

    $ export HUBOT_KATO_LOG_FILE="path/filename.log"

Optional log level (common values 'error', 'debug', 'info'):

    $ export HUBOT_KATO_LOG_LEVEL="debug"
